<h1><b>MIKE O'HEARN</b></h1>
<p>Mike O'Hearn (born January 26, 1969), also known as "Titan" is an American bodybuilder, actor, personal trainer and model. He has been featured on over 500 magazine covers, was Fitness Model of the Year seven times, and is a four-time Mr. "Natural" Universe title holder. He appeared as the gladiator "Titan" on the 2008 revival of American Gladiators. O'Hearn is the only individual to be a Gladiator on both the original (1989â€“96) (as Thor) and the 2008 series.[2] He is the founder of Power Bodybuilding, a training program that focuses on developing both strength and hypertrophy, along with aesthetics</p>

<p>Mike "Titan" O'Hearn came from humble beginnings. He grew up on a farm in Kirkland, WA and is the youngest of 9 brothers and sisters. He began competing in bodybuilding, power lifting, and martial arts at the age of 13. By the age of 15, he won the Teenage Washington State competitions in all three sports. When not training, he is busy writing, producing, and directing his own projects.

<p>Mike is a real-life superhero and a renaissance man in the flesh. Like the bodybuilding greats before him, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, Mike holds 4 Mr. Universe titles and was voted one of the 12 greatest physiques of all time by the fitness industry. Mike is a true champion, well-rounded athlete who has graced over 500 fitness covers (second to Arnold Schwarzenegger), actor and community ambassador

<br><h2>SUPPLEMENTS</h2>Power Bodybuilding ain't easy, my friends. In the gym, it's hardcore, heavy-duty, big-weight brutal. Wanna be a man of steel? Then you've gotta move a lot of iron. Nobody said becoming superhuman was a cinch, but if you're really dedicated to becoming Superman, I'd suggest you get the right stack of supporting supplements.
They'll never replace proper nutrition, but supplements can back up your daily diet and support your intense training efforts. To be better than me, you better lift, eat, and supp like me. Yup, even superheroes can benefit from supplementation. Check out the categories I use to support my training and nutrition.

<h1><b>MOTIVATION<b></h1>
<br><h2>WHITNEY REID</h2>There is truly nobody like Mike. He is a superhero, I promise.

When I first met Mike, I asked him if I could come out to Venice Beach, Calif., and train with him. I heard stories for years about how intense this guy trained, so I had to see for myself. Well, I wasn't ready for what I was about to experience.

He CRUSHED my ego.

Mike is insanely strong -- and when I say strong, I mean it. Mike's not bodybuilding strong, he's world-class powerlifting strong! I trained with many IFBB pros in the past and, for the most part, could hold my own. But this was a different ballgame.

I've seen Mike squat nearly 800 pounds ass-to-calves, bench more than 500 pounds, and deadlift 600 pounds for reps. This is probably why Mike can't keep a steady training partner: nobody trains at his level. I couldn't ask for anyone better to train with. Honestly, I wish I could be there year-round with him at 4:03 a.m. in the Venice Gold's Gym.</br>
<h2>CLARK BARTRAM</h2>
If I had to use one word to describe Mike O'Hearn, honestly ... I couldn't.

Mike is so much more than one word can describe. I guess it comes down to what he is doing: when Mike is with his many fans, he is "approachable;" when he's training, he is "superhuman;" when he's with his dogs, he is "childlike;" around his friends, he is "hilarious;" as a businessman, he's "professional." Attempting to describe Mike O'Hearn with one word is, basically, "impossible." 500-plus covers cannot convey what a genuine person he is.

The bottom line, for me, is that it's an honor to call Mike my "friend.</b>

<h2>MARK DUGDALE</h2>

Training with Mike was brutal - not something you'd expect from a guy who graced the cover of hundreds of magazines. He not only trains heavy and intense, but he's got the stamina to train longer than most disciples of HIIT. I've seen dudes squat big weight, but not without knee wraps and weight belts. While I don't subscribe to any one particular training method as the end-all-be-all, simply because the human body readily adapts to anything over time, "power bodybuilding" is legit. Anyone willing to attempt Mike's routine better prepare to go to war against the iron. Additionally, their nutrition and rest best be in order, or they will never recover. As for the weight Mike lifts - don't attempt that at home
